# Javascript Toolbox

## FHNW - Web Programming Module HS24

In this repository I will collect helpful javascript functions and utilities as we learned them in the webpr module.


It is structured so that my custom webpr-quiz-solver is found under /quizzes, lesson contents in the respective weeks under /lessons, and the "warmup" weekly js goodies in their own folder.
